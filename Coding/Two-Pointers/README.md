# Two Pointers Track

>Status: ⚪ Planned — collate problems requiring dual/multi pointer strategies.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Opposite-direction pointers (sorted arrays, pair sums)
- Same-direction pointers (slow/fast, merging)
- Multiple array traversal
- Partitioning & Dutch flag variants
- Linked list two-pointer tricks
