# Bit Manipulation: Tricks, Patterns & Problem Solving

> Status: üü¢ Comprehensive ‚Äî covers bitwise tricks, code, and classic problems.

## ‚ö° Why Bit Manipulation?
Bit manipulation is a powerful technique for optimizing code, solving tricky problems, and working with sets, masks, and low-level data efficiently.

---

## üß© Core Patterns

- **Bitmasking**: Representing sets, toggling, and checking membership.
- **Bit Tricks**: LSB/MSB, counting set bits, isolating bits, swapping, etc.
- **XOR Properties**: Finding unique elements, toggling, parity checks.
- **Bit DP**: Dynamic programming with state compression (e.g., TSP, subset DP).
- **Gray Codes**: Generating sequences with single-bit changes.

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Bit Manipulation Cheat Sheet

| Operation | Code (Python) | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Set $i$-th bit | `x |= (1 << i)` | Turns on bit $i$ |
| Clear $i$-th bit | `x &= ~(1 << i)` | Turns off bit $i$ |
| Toggle $i$-th bit | `x ^= (1 << i)` | Flips bit $i$ |
| Test $i$-th bit | `(x >> i) & 1` | Checks if bit $i$ is set |
| Count set bits | `bin(x).count('1')` or `ctz(x)` | Number of 1s |
| Isolate LSB | `x & -x` | Gets least significant 1 bit |
| Remove LSB | `x & (x-1)` | Clears least significant 1 bit |
| Power of 2? | `x > 0 and (x & (x-1)) == 0` | Checks if $x$ is power of 2 |
| XOR swap | `a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b` | Swaps $a$ and $b$ |

## üî• Classic Bit Manipulation Problems & Patterns

| Problem | Pattern | Key Trick | Tip |
|---------|---------|----------|-----|
| Subsets of Set | Bitmasking | Loop $0$ to $2^n-1$ | Each bit = include/exclude |
| Single Number | XOR | $a \oplus a = 0$ | XOR all elements |
| Counting Bits | Popcount | `x & (x-1)` | Remove LSB repeatedly |
| Reverse Bits | Bitwise | Shift & mask | Build from LSB to MSB |
| Power of Two | Bitwise | `x & (x-1)` | Only one bit set |
| Bitwise AND of Range | Bitwise | Common prefix | Shift until equal |

## üßë‚ÄçÔøΩ Code Templates

### 1. Generate All Subsets (Bitmask)
```python
def subsets(nums):
	n = len(nums)
	res = []
	for mask in range(1 << n):
		subset = [nums[i] for i in range(n) if (mask >> i) & 1]
		res.append(subset)
	return res
```

### 2. Count Set Bits (Brian Kernighan‚Äôs Algorithm)
```python
def count_bits(x):
	count = 0
	while x:
		x &= x - 1
		count += 1
	return count
```

### 3. Find Single Number (XOR)
```python
def single_number(nums):
	res = 0
	for num in nums:
		res ^= num
	return res
```

### 4. Check Power of Two
```python
def is_power_of_two(x):
	return x > 0 and (x & (x-1)) == 0
```
