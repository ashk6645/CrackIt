# Sliding Window Track

>Status: ⚪ Planned — focus on fixed and variable window techniques.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Fixed-size window sums/averages
- Variable window optimisation (longest substring, count at most k)
- Multiset / frequency map windows
- Two-dimensional windows (matrices)
- Deque-based monotonic window problems
