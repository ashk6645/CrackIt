        // Input validation
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Array must have at least 2 elements");
        }
        
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int currentSum = nums[left] + nums[right];

                return new int[]{left, right};
            } else if (currentSum < target) {
                left++; // Need larger sum
            } else {
                right--; // Need smaller sum
            }
        }
