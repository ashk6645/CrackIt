# Greedy Algorithms Track

>Status: ⚪ Planned — collect optimisation problems solvable via greedy choices.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Interval scheduling & merging
- Activity selection & meeting rooms
- Huffman coding / optimal merge
- Fractional knapsack, job sequencing
- Greedy on graphs (Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra basics)

## 🛠️ Contributor Checklist

- [ ] Add proofs/intuition for greedy correctness where non-trivial.
- [ ] List edge cases to test greedy solution.
- [ ] Provide comparative notes vs dynamic programming solutions.
