# Direction Sense

>Status: âšª Planned â€” outline tricks for orientation, shortest distance, and rotation-based problems.

## ðŸ§­ Coverage

- **Fundamentals**: Cardinal directions, inter-cardinal points, angle relations.
- **Question Types**: Relative directions, turn sequences, shortest path, shadow-based orientation.
- **Tools**: Direction diagramming, coordinate method, rotation matrices for complex turns.

## ðŸ“Œ To-Do

- [ ] Add sample problem illustrating turning logic.
- [ ] Include north-east-south-west quick reference.
- [ ] Create practice drill mixing simple and compound movements.
