# Series & Patterns

>Status: ⚪ Planned — initial framework with guiding questions.

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Toolkit

- **Numeric Series**: Difference, ratio, prime, square/cube, alternating, mixed operations.
- **Alphabet Series**: Position numbers (A=1…Z=26), reverse order, skipping patterns.
- **Visual Series**: Rotation, reflection, number of elements, shading sequence.
- **Hybrid Series**: Combination of numbers and alphabets, alphanumeric coding.

## 🧭 Suggested Workflow

1. **Identify pattern type** – differences, multiples, interwoven sub-series.
2. **Compute successive differences** – 1st, 2nd, 3rd order differences for numeric.
3. **Check alternative positions** – even/odd splitting often reveals dual sequences.
4. **Validate with next element** – confirm logic across multiple terms.
5. **Document pattern** – note the rule for quick revision.

## 📝 Example Types to Add

- [ ] Pure arithmetic series (add/subtract fixed value).
- [ ] Geometric / exponential series.
- [ ] Fibonacci/Tribonacci blends.
- [ ] Alpha-numeric substitution (e.g., alternate letters shifting positions).
- [ ] Figure-based rotation or mirroring problems.

## 🎯 Practice Ideas

- Solve 20-question drill segregated by pattern type.
- Maintain flashcards for common difference/ratio sequences.
- Practice with puzzle books (e.g., R.S. Aggarwal reasoning) and CAT LR sets.

## 📌 Contribution Checklist

- [ ] Add at least 5 solved examples covering varied patterns.
- [ ] Include set of quick-recognition tips (e.g., squares, cubes, triangular numbers).
- [ ] Provide timed worksheet PDF links.
