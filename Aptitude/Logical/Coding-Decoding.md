# Coding-Decoding

>Status: ⚪ Planned — fill with substitution patterns and decoding frameworks.

## 🔐 Core Coverage

- **Letter shifting**: Forward/backward fixed shifts, alternating shifts.
- **Substitution coding**: Replacement with symbols/numbers.
- **Word coding**: Assigning codes to words with letter-level mapping.
- **Conditional coding**: Applying given operations under conditions.
- **Mathematical coding**: Numbers replacing operations (BODMAS awareness).

## 🧠 Tasks for Contributors

- [ ] Add examples of each coding style with explanation.
- [ ] Include strategy to map letters using tabular format.
