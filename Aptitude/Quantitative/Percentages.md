# Percentages

>Status: üü° Draft ‚Äì includes quick reference formulas and starter examples.

## üîç Concept Snapshot

Percentages convert ratios into a base of 100, enabling easy comparison of growth, discount, and composition problems. Interview questions often mix percentages with profit/loss, mixture-alligation, or DI charts.

- Translate verbal statements into algebraic percentage equations quickly.
- Recognise complement pairs (increase vs decrease) and successive change.
- Use fraction ‚Üî percentage conversions mentally (e.g., $1/8 = 12.5\%$).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Idea Checklist

- [ ] Percentage to fraction benchmarks (5%, 6.25%, 12.5%, 16\tfrac{2}{3}%, 20%, 25%, 33\tfrac{1}{3}%, 40%, 50%, 66\tfrac{2}{3}%, 75%).
- [ ] Successive percentage increase/decrease: $x\%$ then $y\%$ ‚áí net = $x + y + \frac{xy}{100}$.
- [ ] Percentage points vs percent change.
- [ ] Base change problems (changing denominator reference).
- [ ] Mixture/Alligation tie-ins with percentage strengths.
- [ ] Population growth/decay models with compound percentages.

## üßÆ Handy Formulas

| Scenario | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Converting fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ to percentage | $\frac{a}{b} \times 100\%$ |
| Percentage change | $\frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100\%$ |
| Successive change | $(1 + \frac{x}{100})(1 + \frac{y}{100}) - 1$ |
| Discount ‚Üí Selling price | $SP = MP \times (1 - \frac{d}{100})$ |
| Profit/Loss percentage | $\frac{SP - CP}{CP} \times 100\%$ |

## üß† Worked Illustrations

### 1. Successive Discount
A store offers a 20% discount followed by an additional 10% discount on a laptop with MRP ‚Çπ50,000. What is the final price?

$SP = 50,000 \times 0.8 \times 0.9 = \textbf{‚Çπ36,000}$.

### 2. Base Change Trick
A salary increases from ‚Çπ40,000 to ‚Çπ46,000. Later it drops to ‚Çπ42,000. Find overall percentage change from original salary.

Net change = $\frac{42,000 - 40,000}{40,000} \times 100 = 5\%$ increase. (Alternative: +15% then -8.695% approx. Using net formula: $15 + (-8.695) + \frac{15 \times (-8.695)}{100} \approx 5$.)
