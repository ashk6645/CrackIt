# Profit & Loss

>Status: 🟢 Complete — comprehensive guide with all profit-loss scenarios and shortcuts.

## 🚀 Quick Overview

Profit & Loss problems form the backbone of commercial mathematics in aptitude tests. These questions test your understanding of cost price, selling price, markups, discounts, and various trading scenarios. Mastering these concepts is crucial for success in competitive exams.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Fundamental Definitions
- **Cost Price (CP)**: Price at which an article is purchased
- **Selling Price (SP)**: Price at which an article is sold
- **Marked Price (MP)**: Price marked on the article (list price)
- **Discount**: Reduction given on marked price
- **Profit**: When SP > CP (Profit = SP - CP)
- **Loss**: When SP < CP (Loss = CP - SP)

### Key Relationships
- **SP = CP + Profit** (in case of profit)
- **SP = CP - Loss** (in case of loss)
- **SP = MP - Discount**
- **MP = SP + Discount**

## 🧮 Essential Formulas

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Profit % | (Profit/CP) × 100 = [(SP-CP)/CP] × 100 |
| Loss % | (Loss/CP) × 100 = [(CP-SP)/CP] × 100 |
| SP when profit % given | CP × (100 + Profit%)/100 |
| SP when loss % given | CP × (100 - Loss%)/100 |
| CP when SP and profit % given | SP × 100/(100 + Profit%) |
| CP when SP and loss % given | SP × 100/(100 - Loss%) |
| Successive Discount | Net Discount% = d1 + d2 - (d1×d2)/100 |
| Discount % | (Discount/MP) × 100 |

## 🎯 Advanced Formulas & Shortcuts

### 1. When SP is same but CP different
If two articles are sold at same SP with x% profit and y% loss respectively:
- **Overall Loss % = [x×y/(100+x)] %**

### 2. When CP is same but SP different  
If two articles are sold at same CP, one at x% profit and other at y% loss:
- **Overall Profit/Loss % = (x-y)/2 %**

### 3. False Weight Problems
If a shopkeeper uses 'w' gm weight instead of 1000 gm:
- **Profit % = [(1000-w)/w] × 100**

### 4. Mixture & Alligation in Profit-Loss
When mixing articles of different cost prices in ratio m:n:
- **Average CP = (m×CP1 + n×CP2)/(m+n)**

## 🧑‍💻 Solved Examples

### Example 1: Basic Profit Calculation
**Q**: A shopkeeper bought an article for Rs. 800 and sold it for Rs. 920. Find the profit percentage.

**Solution**:
- CP = Rs. 800, SP = Rs. 920
- Profit = SP - CP = 920 - 800 = Rs. 120
- Profit % = (120/800) × 100 = 15%

### Example 2: Reverse Calculation
**Q**: An article is sold for Rs. 816 at a loss of 15%. Find the cost price.

**Solution**:
- SP = Rs. 816, Loss% = 15%
- CP = SP × 100/(100 - Loss%) = 816 × 100/85 = Rs. 960

### Example 3: Successive Discounts
**Q**: A shirt is marked at Rs. 1200. If successive discounts of 20% and 15% are given, find the selling price.

**Solution**:
Method 1 (Step by step):
- After 20% discount: 1200 × 80/100 = Rs. 960
- After 15% discount: 960 × 85/100 = Rs. 816

Method 2 (Formula):
- Net discount = 20 + 15 - (20×15)/100 = 35 - 3 = 32%
- SP = 1200 × 68/100 = Rs. 816

### Example 4: Equal Selling Price Problem
**Q**: Two articles are sold for Rs. 500 each. One gains 25% and the other loses 20%. Find the overall profit or loss percentage.

**Solution**:
- For 25% profit: CP1 = 500 × 100/125 = Rs. 400
- For 20% loss: CP2 = 500 × 100/80 = Rs. 625
- Total CP = 400 + 625 = Rs. 1025
- Total SP = 500 + 500 = Rs. 1000
- Loss = 1025 - 1000 = Rs. 25
- Loss% = (25/1025) × 100 = 2.44%

### Example 5: False Weight Problem
**Q**: A dishonest shopkeeper uses a weight of 900g instead of 1000g. Find his profit percentage.

**Solution**:
- He gives 900g for the price of 1000g
- Profit% = [(1000-900)/900] × 100 = (100/900) × 100 = 11.11%

### Example 6: Markup and Discount
**Q**: A trader marks his goods 40% above cost price and gives a discount of 15%. Find his profit percentage.

**Solution**:
- Let CP = Rs. 100
- MP = 100 + 40% of 100 = Rs. 140
- SP = 140 - 15% of 140 = 140 × 85/100 = Rs. 119
- Profit% = (119-100)/100 × 100 = 19%

## 🔥 Problem Types & Strategies

### 1. Single Article Problems
**Strategy**: Direct application of basic formulas

### 2. Multiple Articles with Same CP/SP
**Strategy**: Use weighted average or aggregate method

### 3. Successive Operations
**Strategy**: Apply operations step by step or use net effect formulas

### 4. Partnership & Profit Sharing
**Strategy**: Profit sharing in ratio of investments

### 5. Commission & Brokerage
**Strategy**: Treat commission as additional cost or reduced selling price
