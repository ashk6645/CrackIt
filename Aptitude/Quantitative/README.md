## ğŸ“… Suggested Sprint Cycle

1. **Concept Refresh (Day 1-2)** â€“ skim theory, rebuild formula sheets.
2. **Worked Examples (Day 3-4)** â€“ solve curated solved examples from each topic file.
3. **Speed Drills (Day 5)** â€“ timed sets (15â€“20 questions) mixing recent topics.
4. **Mock & Review (Day 6-7)** â€“ take a full-length sectional test, log misses in the tracker.
