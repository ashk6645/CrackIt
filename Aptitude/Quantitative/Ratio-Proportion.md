## 📚 Core Concepts

### Ratio
- A ratio is a comparison of two quantities by division.
- If a and b are two numbers, their ratio is a : b = a/b.
- Ratios are always expressed in the simplest form.

### Proportion
- Proportion is an equation stating that two ratios are equal.
- If a : b = c : d, then a, b, c, d are in proportion (a/b = c/d).

### Variation
- **Direct Variation**: y ∝ x (y increases as x increases)
- **Inverse Variation**: y ∝ 1/x (y decreases as x increases)
- **Joint Variation**: y ∝ xz

### Compound & Duplicate Ratios
- **Compound Ratio**: Product of two or more ratios (a:b) × (c:d) = ac:bd
- **Duplicate Ratio**: Square of a ratio (a:b)² = a²:b²
- **Subduplicate Ratio**: Square root of a ratio (a:b)½ = √a:√b

## 🧮 Essential Formulas

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Ratio of a to b | a : b = a/b |
| Proportion | a : b = c : d ⇒ a/b = c/d |
| Partnership (profit share) | Share ∝ Investment × Time |
| Mixture (alligation) | Mean Price = (Quantity₁×Price₁ + Quantity₂×Price₂)/(Quantity₁+Quantity₂) |
| Direct Variation | y₁/x₁ = y₂/x₂ |
| Inverse Variation | x₁y₁ = x₂y₂ |

## 🧑‍💻 Solved Examples

### Example 1: Simplifying Ratios
**Q**: Simplify the ratio 150:250.
**Solution**: 150/250 = 3/5 ⇒ Ratio = 3:5

### Example 2: Proportion
**Q**: If 3:4 = 6:x, find x.
**Solution**: 3/4 = 6/x ⇒ 3x = 24 ⇒ x = 8

### Example 3: Partnership
**Q**: A invests Rs. 5000 for 12 months, B invests Rs. 6000 for 8 months. Find profit share ratio.
**Solution**: A's share = 5000×12 = 60000; B's share = 6000×8 = 48000; Ratio = 60000:48000 = 5:4

### Example 4: Mixture/Alligation
**Q**: In what ratio must water be mixed with milk at Rs. 30/litre so that the mixture is worth Rs. 24/litre?
**Solution**: By alligation:
| Water (Rs. 0) | Mixture (Rs. 24) | Milk (Rs. 30) |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| 30-24 = 6     |                  | 24-0 = 24     |
So, ratio = 6:24 = 1:4 (water:milk)

### Example 5: Direct & Inverse Variation
**Q**: If 8 workers can complete a job in 12 days, how many days will 6 workers take?
**Solution**: 8×12 = 6×x ⇒ x = 16 days
