# Permutation & Combination

>Status: ⚪ Planned — add counting principles, permutations with/without repetition, circular arrangements.

## 📋 Proposed Flow

- **Counting Principles**: Fundamental principle of counting, permutations, combinations.
- **Variations**: Repetition allowed, circular permutations, identical objects.
- **Advanced Topics**: Distribution of objects, derangements, combinatorial proofs.
- **Integration**: Link with probability and combinatorics-based DI.
- **Practice Sets**: Tiered problem sets with explanations.

## 🛠️ Contributions Needed

- [ ] Provide formula table for permutations & combinations.
- [ ] Add solved example on circular arrangement with restrictions.
- [ ] Include derangement problem set.
