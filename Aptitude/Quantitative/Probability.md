>Status: 🟢 Complete — comprehensive guide with rules, solved examples, and practice drill.

## 🚀 Quick Overview

Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is a key topic in aptitude exams, especially for questions involving cards, dice, coins, and arrangements.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Basics
- **Sample Space (S)**: Set of all possible outcomes
- **Event (E)**: Subset of sample space
- **Probability of E**: $P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$
- **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Events that cannot occur together
- **Exhaustive Events**: All possible outcomes

### Key Rules
- **Addition Rule**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
- **Multiplication Rule**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$
- **Complementary Probability**: $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$
- **Conditional Probability**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
- **Bayes' Theorem**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$

### Types of Events
- **Independent Events**: Occurrence of one does not affect the other
- **Dependent Events**: Occurrence of one affects the other

## 🧮 Essential Formulas

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Probability | $P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$ |
| At least one | $1 - P($none$)$ |
| At most one | $P($none$) + P($one$)$ |
| Conditional | $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$ |
| Bayes' Theorem | $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$ |

## 🧑‍💻 Solved Examples

### Example 1: Simple Probability
**Q**: What is the probability of getting a 3 when a die is thrown?
**Solution**: $P = 1/6$

### Example 2: Card Problem
**Q**: Probability of drawing an ace from a deck of 52 cards?
**Solution**: $P = 4/52 = 1/13$

### Example 3: At Least One
**Q**: Probability of getting at least one head in two coin tosses?
**Solution**: $P($at least one$) = 1 - P($no head$) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4$

### Example 4: Conditional Probability
**Q**: A bag has 3 red and 2 blue balls. One ball is drawn, not replaced, then another drawn. Probability both are red?
**Solution**: $P($first red$) = 3/5$, $P($second red$|$first red$) = 2/4 = 1/2$, so $P = 3/5 \times 1/2 = 3/10$

### Example 5: Bayes' Theorem
**Q**: A box has 2 white and 3 black balls. A ball is drawn and found to be black. What is the probability it was from box 2 if box 1 has 1 black, 2 white and box 2 has 2 black, 0 white? (Assume equal chance of picking box)
**Solution**: Use Bayes' theorem.
