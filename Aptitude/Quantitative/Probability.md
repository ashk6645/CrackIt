>Status: âšª Planned â€” outline key probability rules, distributions, and common traps.

## ðŸ§  Structure

- **Basics**: Sample space, events, mutually exclusive/exhaustive events, conditional probability.
- **Key Rules**: Addition, multiplication, Bayes' theorem, complementary probability.
- **Problem Types**: Cards, dice, coins, selection without replacement, arrangement probability.
- **Advanced Angles**: Independent vs dependent events, inclusion-exclusion, expected value.
- **Practice**: Progressive worksheet (easy â†’ medium â†’ challenge).

## ðŸ“Œ TODO

- [ ] Create concept map for conditional probability vs independence.
- [ ] Add example applying Bayes' theorem.
- [ ] Compile list of common misinterpretations.
