# Geometry

>Status: âšª Planned â€” compile formulas, theorems, and visual tricks for 2D/3D geometry.

## ðŸ§­ Coverage Plan

- **Plane Geometry**: Triangles, quadrilaterals, circles, polygons.
- **Mensuration**: Area & perimeter of 2D shapes, surface area & volume of 3D solids.
- **Coordinate Geometry**: Distance, section formula, area of triangle, line equations.
- **Advanced Problems**: Loci, rotation, shadow/angle of elevation & depression.
- **Revision Tools**: Formula sheet + diagram pack.

## ðŸ“Œ Pending Tasks

- [ ] Add tabular formula summary for common shapes.
- [ ] Include example on circle tangents & chords.
- [ ] Provide 3D geometry visualization references.
