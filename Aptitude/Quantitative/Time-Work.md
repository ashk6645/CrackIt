# Time & Work

>Status: 🟢 Complete — comprehensive guide with work-rate techniques and shortcuts.

## � Quick Overview

Time & Work problems test your ability to understand rates, efficiency, and collaborative work scenarios. The core principle is: **Work = Rate × Time**. These problems frequently appear in aptitude tests, often combined with pipes & cisterns variations.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Fundamental Formula
- **Work = Rate × Time**
- **Rate = Work / Time**
- **Time = Work / Rate**

### Key Principles
- If A can do work in 'n' days, A's rate = 1/n work per day
- Combined rate = Sum of individual rates
- Efficiency ∝ 1/Time taken
- Work is always considered as 1 unit (whole work)

### Efficiency Ratios
If A:B:C can do work in x:y:z days, their efficiency ratio = 1/x : 1/y : 1/z

## 🧮 Essential Formulas

| Scenario | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| A alone completes in 'a' days, B in 'b' days | Combined rate = 1/a + 1/b |
| A and B together in 't' days | Time = 1/(1/a + 1/b) |
| Work efficiency ratio | If A:B = m:n, then Time ratio = n:m |
| Pipes & Cisterns | Inlet rate + Outlet rate = Net rate |
| Wages distribution | Wages ∝ Work done ∝ Efficiency × Time |

## 🎯 Problem Types & Strategies

### 1. Basic Work Problems
**Strategy**: Use LCM method for easy calculation
- Find LCM of individual days
- Calculate work rates accordingly

### 2. Pipes & Cisterns
**Strategy**: Treat filling as positive, emptying as negative
- Inlet pipe rate = +1/time
- Outlet pipe rate = -1/time

### 3. Alternate Day Work
**Strategy**: Calculate work in complete cycles, then handle remainder

### 4. Work & Wages
**Strategy**: Wages ∝ Work done = Efficiency × Days worked

## 🧑‍💻 Solved Examples

### Example 1: Basic Combined Work
**Q**: A can complete a work in 12 days and B can complete it in 18 days. In how many days can they complete the work together?

**Solution**:
- A's rate = 1/12 per day
- B's rate = 1/18 per day
- Combined rate = 1/12 + 1/18 = (3+2)/36 = 5/36 per day
- Time together = 1 ÷ (5/36) = 36/5 = 7.2 days

### Example 2: Efficiency Ratio
**Q**: A, B, and C can do work individually in 6, 8, and 12 days respectively. If they work together, in how many days will the work be completed?

**Solution**:
- LCM of 6, 8, 12 = 24
- A's rate = 24/6 = 4 units/day
- B's rate = 24/8 = 3 units/day  
- C's rate = 24/12 = 2 units/day
- Combined rate = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 units/day
- Time = 24/9 = 8/3 = 2⅔ days

### Example 3: Pipes & Cisterns
**Q**: Pipe A can fill a tank in 6 hours, pipe B in 8 hours, and pipe C can empty it in 12 hours. If all three are opened together, in how many hours will the tank be filled?

**Solution**:
- A's rate = +1/6 per hour
- B's rate = +1/8 per hour
- C's rate = -1/12 per hour
- Net rate = 1/6 + 1/8 - 1/12 = (4+3-2)/24 = 5/24 per hour
- Time = 1 ÷ (5/24) = 24/5 = 4.8 hours

### Example 4: Alternate Day Work
**Q**: A and B work on alternate days starting with A. A alone can complete the work in 16 days and B alone in 12 days. In how many days will the work be completed?

**Solution**:
- A's rate = 1/16, B's rate = 1/12
- In 2 days: Work = 1/16 + 1/12 = (3+4)/48 = 7/48
- Time for complete work = 48/7 ≈ 6.86 cycles
- 6 complete cycles = 12 days, work done = 6 × 7/48 = 42/48 = 7/8
- Remaining = 1/8, done by A on 13th day = (1/8)/(1/16) = 2 days
- But A needs only 1/8 work, so time = (1/8) × 16 = 2 days
- Total = 12 + 2 = 14 days

### Example 5: Work & Wages
**Q**: A, B, and C together earn Rs. 1620 for completing a work. A alone can do it in 6 days, B in 8 days, and C in 12 days. Find their individual shares.

**Solution**:
- Efficiency ratio A:B:C = 1/6 : 1/8 : 1/12 = 4:3:2
- Total ratio = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9
- A's share = (4/9) × 1620 = Rs. 720
- B's share = (3/9) × 1620 = Rs. 540
- C's share = (2/9) × 1620 = Rs. 360

### Example 6: Advanced Pipes Problem
**Q**: Two pipes A and B can fill a cistern in 20 and 30 minutes respectively. Both are opened together but after 5 minutes, B is turned off. In what time will the cistern be full?

**Solution**:
- Combined rate for first 5 minutes = 1/20 + 1/30 = 5/60 = 1/12 per minute
- Work done in 5 minutes = 5 × (1/12) = 5/12
- Remaining work = 1 - 5/12 = 7/12
- Time for A alone to complete remaining = (7/12) ÷ (1/20) = (7/12) × 20 = 35/3 minutes
- Total time = 5 + 35/3 = 50/3 = 16⅔ minutes
