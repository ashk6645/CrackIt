# Algebra

>Status: ⚪ Planned — populate with identities, inequalities, and quadratic tools.

## 🗺️ Section Layout

- **Foundational Concepts**: Linear equations, quadratic equations, inequalities, absolute value.
- **Identities**: $(a\pm b)^2$, $a^3 \pm b^3$, $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc$, AM-GM.
- **Equation Systems**: Simultaneous linear equations, substitution, elimination, cross-multiplication.
- **Inequalities**: Cauchy, AM-GM, triangle inequality, modulus cases.
- **Practice Zone**: Problem ladder with increasing difficulty.

## 📌 Action Items

- [ ] Add cheat sheet of algebraic identities.
- [ ] Include inequality problem with solution via AM-GM.
- [ ] Create 10-question quiz mixing linear & quadratic systems.
