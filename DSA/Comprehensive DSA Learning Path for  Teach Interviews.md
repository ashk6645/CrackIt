Study Approach
For each topic:

Study the theoretical concepts
Implement basic operations
Solve easy problems
Move to medium problems
Finally tackle hard problems
Practice Strategy:

Start with LeetCode Easy problems
Progress to Medium problems
Finally tackle Hard problems
Focus on one pattern at a time
Review and revise regularly
Mock Interviews:

Practice with time constraints
Explain approach while coding
Handle edge cases
Write clean, efficient code
Test your code
Important Resources
Websites:

LeetCode
HackerRank
CodeForces
GeeksforGeeks
InterviewBit
Books:

"Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS)
"Algorithm Design Manual" by Skiena
"Cracking the Coding Interview"
"Elements of Programming Interviews"
Progress Tracking
Keep a log of solved problems
Note patterns and approaches used
Review mistakes and learnings
Track time taken for each problem
Maintain an error log
Interview Preparation Tips
Time Management:

Aim to solve easy problems in 15-20 minutes
Medium problems in 30-45 minutes
Hard problems in 45-60 minutes
Communication:

Practice explaining your approach
Think out loud while solving
Ask clarifying questions
Discuss trade-offs
Code Quality:

Write clean, readable code
Use meaningful variable names
Handle edge cases
Add necessary comments
Follow coding standards
Remember: Consistency is key. Aim to solve at least 2-3 problems daily and revise previously solved problems regularly.
