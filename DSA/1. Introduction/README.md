# üìò Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

## What are Data Structures and Algorithms?

### Data Structures
A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Think of data structures like different types of containers:
- **Array**: Like a row of numbered boxes
- **Stack**: Like a stack of plates (last in, first out)
- **Queue**: Like a line at a coffee shop (first in, first out)
- **Tree**: Like a family tree with hierarchical relationships

### Algorithms
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.

Examples in daily life:
- **Recipe**: Step-by-step instructions to cook a dish
- **GPS Navigation**: Algorithm to find shortest path
- **Search Engine**: Algorithm to find relevant web pages

## Learning Mindset

### ‚úÖ Do's
- **Start Simple**: Master basics before advanced topics
- **Practice Regularly**: Solve problems daily
- **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on concepts
- **Draw Diagrams**: Visualize data structures
- **Time Yourself**: Build problem-solving speed
- **Learn Multiple Languages**: Each has strengths

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- **Don't Rush**: Take time to understand concepts
- **Don't Skip Theory**: Implementation without understanding fails
- **Don't Give Up**: Every expert was once a beginner
- **Don't Compare**: Everyone learns at different pace
- **Don't Just Copy**: Write code yourself

## Prerequisites

### Programming Basics
```python
# Variables and data types
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True

# Control structures
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

# Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Functions
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
