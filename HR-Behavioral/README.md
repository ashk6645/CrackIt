## 🌟 The STAR Method Framework

### ⭐ What is STAR?
**S**ituation → **T**ask → **A**ction → **R**esult

A proven framework for structuring behavioral interview responses.

### 📝 STAR Template
```
Situation: Set the context and background
Task: Explain what needed to be accomplished
Action: Describe what you specifically did
Result: Share the outcomes and learnings
```

### 💡 Example Application
**Question**: "Tell me about a time you led a team."

**STAR Response**:
- **Situation**: "During my final semester, our team of 6 was assigned a complex web application project..."
- **Task**: "As the team lead, I needed to coordinate different components and ensure timely delivery..."
- **Action**: "I implemented daily standups, created a task tracking system, and assigned roles based on strengths..."
