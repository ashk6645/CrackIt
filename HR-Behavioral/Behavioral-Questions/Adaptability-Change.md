# Adaptability & Change Questions

>Status: 🟡 Draft — ready for practice; add more example stories from real interviews to promote it to 🟢.

## 🎯 What Interviewers Probe

Hiring managers test how you operate when plans shift, stakeholders push back, or ambiguity spikes. They look for:

- **Awareness** of the trigger for change and why it mattered.
- **Speed** and **quality of decisions** made while facts were evolving.
- **Emotional regulation** — keeping teams aligned, calm, and motivated.
- **Learning loop** — how you captured lessons and prevented repeat issues.

## 🗣️ Sample Prompts

Use these to rehearse responses. Tailor the industry-specific details to your background.

1. "Tell me about a time a project requirement changed close to launch. What did you do?"
2. "Describe a situation where you had to learn a new tool or domain quickly to deliver results."
3. "Share an experience where a teammate left and you had to keep the initiative on track."
4. "When have external factors (regulation, client demand, market event) forced you to pivot?"
5. "Talk about a time you received critical feedback mid-project and how you responded."

## 🧱 STAR Framework: Templates & Examples

Use the following scaffold to craft tight answers. Keep responses under 2 minutes unless asked to elaborate.

### Template

- **Situation**: Clarify context, scale, stakeholders, and timeline.
- **Task**: Share your ownership or expectations set on you.
- **Action**: Describe *specific* steps you took — decisions, communication, prioritisation.
- **Result**: Quantify outcome, mention feedback, spotlight learning.

### Example 1 — Sudden Scope Increase

- **S**: "Three weeks before feature freeze, compliance mandated two-factor authentication for our payments module affecting 120k monthly users."
- **T**: "As the module owner, I had to ship the update without slipping release or breaking flows."
- **A**: "I convened a war-room with security + backend leads, created a risk matrix, reprioritised backlog items, and set up twice-daily syncs. We prototyped with a small cohort and rolled changes behind feature flags."
- **R**: "We launched on time, saw <1% support tickets in the first week, and compliance credited us for the fastest policy adoption that quarter. Documented the rollout playbook for future audits."

### Example 2 — Tooling Pivot

- **S**: "Our data team sunset the legacy ETL platform mid-quarter. My analytics project depended on it for daily sales pipelines."
- **T**: "I needed to migrate pipelines to BigQuery in 10 days to keep leadership dashboards live."
- **A**: "I paired with a senior data engineer, mapped critical transformations, scripted automated tests, and hosted brown-bag sessions for analysts so everyone could self-serve."
- **R**: "Migration finished two days early, report latency dropped from 6h to 45m, and analysts adopted the new workflow with minimal support calls. I later trained two peers, reducing bus-factor risk."

## 🔑 Behaviours to Highlight

| Behaviour | Signals Interviewer Hears | Tips to Communicate |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Proactive communication | Stakeholders informed, surprises minimised | Mention cadence of updates and who you looped in |
| Prioritisation | You evaluated trade-offs deliberately | Share criteria (impact, dependencies, risk) |
| Learning mindset | You captured insights for next time | Reference retros, playbooks, or metrics improvements |
| Emotional resilience | You kept morale up and anchored teams in facts | Describe how you acknowledged concerns and provided clarity |

## 🧪 Self-Reflection Sprint

Work through these prompts to unearth strong stories:

1. **Inventory shifts**: List three projects where assumptions changed. Note stakeholders, blockers, measurable impact.
2. **Map your response**: For each, write 3 bullet points under S/T/A/R. Identify which competencies each story shows (e.g., leadership, innovation).
3. **Surface the learning**: Summarise what you’d repeat vs. change next time. Highlight new skills, tools, or processes adopted.
4. **Anticipate follow-ups**: Prepare answers for "What would you do differently?" and "How did the team react?"

## 🛠️ Practice Routine

- **Solo rehearsal**: Record yourself answering one prompt daily; watch for filler words and clarity.
- **Peer mock**: Pair with a friend/mentor. Have them challenge your story with follow-up questions about metrics or stakeholder pushback.
- **Upgrade log**: Maintain a running document noting refined phrasing, metrics, and feedback received.
